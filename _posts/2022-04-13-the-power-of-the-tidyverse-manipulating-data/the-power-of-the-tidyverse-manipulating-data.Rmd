Hello! In this post I will show you how to use the basic verbs of the tidyverse:

* select()
* arrange()
* filter()
* mutate()

All these verbs are also great *functions* to deal with data from the real world, but since gathering this data can be very time useful we will use a built in dataset from R.

Let's have a look in the Iris dataset which gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*.

And of course since we are dealing with the tidyverse we have to call it:

`library(tidyverse)`

we can call it and have a look:
`iris`
or just a part of it:
`head(iris)`
or just a glimpse for those who love stats:
`glimpse(iris)`

First of all let's start with select and since we are using a tidyverse way of thinking, we are going to start using *pipes* also known as *%>%* or *|>*, depends on which you prefer to write.

So, to select a sort of columns you wish you can:

```
iris %>% #here we are calling the data
select(Sepal.Length, Species) #here we are calling the function select and choosing two columns
```
